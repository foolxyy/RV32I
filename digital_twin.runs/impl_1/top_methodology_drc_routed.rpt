2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-10#1 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at student_top_inst/Core_cpu/u_ex/mul_temp of size 16x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#2 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at student_top_inst/Core_cpu/u_ex/mul_temp__0 of size 16x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#3 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at student_top_inst/Core_cpu/u_ex/mul_temp__1 of size 18x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#4 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at student_top_inst/Core_cpu/u_ex/mul_temp__2 of size 18x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

ULMTCS-1#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 4322 control sets (vs. available limit of 50950, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.
Related violations: <none>
